    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it. --> actually this is a reference

    const team = players
    console.log(players, team)
    // team[3] = 'Loki'

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const teams2 = players.slice()
    teams2[3] = 'Loki'
        

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(teams2)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    team4[3] = 'Lyon'

    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person
    // captain.number = 99

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age:12})

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const person3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    }

    const dev = Object.assign({}, char)

  //This makes a deep clone
    const dev2 =  JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(dev))
